# product_admin
A basic product administration tool I made at University.

You need to download H2 Database from http://h2database.com/html/main.html before using this app.

Run H2 using the corresponding executable file for your OS.
Then run the app.
From the app you may add a new product and set its details.
You may then view the products in the database via the view products button.

Unfortunately I didn't put any documentation for this project :<
